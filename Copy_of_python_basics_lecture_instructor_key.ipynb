Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.\n",

Today Python is used in almost every industry for things like artificial intelligence engineering, web design, financial modelling and planning, healthcare and many more. Python can be used to create **front end** components like web applications and desktop GUIs (Graphical User Interface). Front end components are those components of an application that a user can interact with. They are likely what you're currently most familiar with. They are the buttons, search bars, and pages you click and manipulate when you use a computer application. As you will learn however there is much more to even a simple application or program than the front end. The **back end** components of an application are abstracted away from the user by the front end but consist of components like databases, APIs (application program interface), caches and more. Don't worry if you're a little confused at this point but if you would like to know more about the difference between the front and back end of an application an article is available [here](https://kenzie.snhu.edu/blog/front-end-vs-back-end-whats-the-difference/) (*hint: this might be helpful for the assignment*).\n",
